2.  Download and compile the test application

Download SRV1Test java from http://www.surveyor.com/blackfin/#blackfin5
Save it to some directory.  In my case I put it in ~/surveyor

Open a shell and move to the directory in which you saved
the file, then type:

Listing the contents of the directory should show a whole 
bunch of class files generated.
